[The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda) was adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries—developed and developing —in a global partnership. The SDGs recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

Sustainability is often broken into three intertwined categories: `social sustainability`, `economic sustainability`, and `environmental sustainability`. All these three pillars of sustainability require healthy competition to bloom. As UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi [pointed out](https://unctad.org/news/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-will-need-healthy-competition-and-consumer-protection): "Healthy competition in both national and international markets ensures that the private sector makes better products at lower prices affordable to more people, and this will be important in achieving the SDGs".

Competition laws aim to ensure healthy competition and the protection of consumers by preventing market distortions: notably by prohibiting cartels, abuses of dominant position, reviewing mergers and acquisitions, and in Europe, also State aids. 

In the EU, the main goals of competition law—as determined by the EU Courts—is to increase economic efficiency (including allocative, productive, and dynamic efficiencies) and consumer welfare, however, the protection and the enhancement of the internal market is still being regarded as a superior goal. Consequently, competition law is an essential tool to foster common action for global challenges, i.e. digitalization and AI, post-COVID recovery, and sustainable development. These three key challenges identified by the European Commission in [November 2021](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/documents-register/detail?ref=COM(2021)713&lang=en) require common, even global action.

By promoting healthy competition and the maximization of economic efficiency competition law, therefore, also protects the foundation stone of the UN SDGs.
